## Input File Formats

### **1. NMR Data Files**

lunaNMR uses [nmrglue](https://github.com/jjhelmus/nmrglue) to support a wide range of NMR data formats:

#### **Supported Formats**
- **Bruker TopSpin:** processed files (`1r`, `2rr`)
- **JEOL:** Delta format files
- **NMRPipe:** `.ft` files
- **Sparky:** `.ucsf` files

#### **Bruker Format Example**
```
your_experiment/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ acqus          # Acquisition parameters
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ acqu2s         # 2D acquisition parameters (if applicable)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ procs          # Processing parameters
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ proc2s         # 2D processing parameters (if applicable)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fid            # Raw FID data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1r             # Processed 1D spectrum
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2rr            # Processed 2D spectrum
```

#### **File Requirements**
- **2D spectra:** Both dimensions must be properly calibrated
- **Processing:** Processed data preferred for peak detection

### **2. Peak List Files**

Peak lists define the positions of interest for analysis. Multiple formats are supported:

#### **Format : Simple Text Format**
```
Assignment, Position_X, Position_Y
1, 8, 110
2, 9, 112
3, 10, 111
```


#### **Field Specifications**
- **Assignment** Unique identifier for each peak
- **Position_X** ¬πH chemical shift in ppm (float, typically 6.0-12.0)
- **Position_Y** ¬π‚ÅµN chemical shift in ppm (float, typically 100-140) [optional]


### **3. dynamiXs Data Files**

For time-series analysis (T‚ÇÅ, T‚ÇÇ, relaxation studies):

#### **Format: Multi-Column CSV**
```csv
# T1 Relaxation Series Data
# Time delays: 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 seconds
Residue,0.01,0.05,0.1,0.3,0.6,0.9,1.2,1.8,2.4
A5,1250.3,1098.2,967.4,745.1,532.8,424.6,315.2,198.7,125.4
L6,1456.7,1323.4,1189.2,961.5,742.3,628.9,417.1,302.8,201.2
V7,1123.8,1087.1,1034.5,823.2,651.7,498.3,387.9,245.1,156.7
I8,2234.1,2156.8,2087.3,1823.7,1456.2,1198.4,897.6,623.4,412.8
F9,1876.4,1798.2,1723.9,1456.7,1234.5,987.3,756.8,534.2,387.1
```

#### **Requirements**
- **First column:** Residue identifiers matching peak list
- **Header row:** Time points or experimental parameters
- **Data matrix:** Intensity values for each residue/time point
- **Missing data:** Use `NaN` or empty cells for missing values
